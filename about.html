          I have implemented a responsive website layout using Tailwind CSS, ensuring the website
          adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. I installed tailwind CLI to the
          project, added images and custom fonts to improve design. I also initialise git repository
          and uploaded the project to github to practise version control.

        </dt>
        <dd class="text-gray-700 pl-4">
          One of the challenges that I have is that since I have been using tailwind, I need to
          regenerate style.css after every design changes. While it works well locally, sometimes
          syncing style.css to web dev server does not work properly, especially when I connect AUT
          server from home. It causes some delay in testing and developement. However, I managed to
          work around this issue by testing design locally before I upload to server.

        <dd class="text-gray-700 pl-4">
          I would be imporving UI/UX with more interesting and interactive design, such as dark mode
          toggler. I would also be implementing more error handling and creating more reusable
          components to enhance efficiency and consistency.

        <dd class="text-gray-700 pl-4">
          During this assignment, I have gained experiences with SQL operation and how PHP handle
          those operation. Also gained more experiences on creating clean and interactive design
          using CSS framework. I also learnt more about server side input validation techniques and
          regular expressions.
